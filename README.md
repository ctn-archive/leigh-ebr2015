Hemineglect
===========

Damage to the right parietal cortex often leads to a syndrome known as
unilateral neglect in which the patient fails to attend or respond to
stimuli in left space. Recent work attempting to rehabilitate the
disorder has made use of rightward-shifting prisms that displace
visual input further rightward. After a brief period of adaptation to
prisms many of the symptoms of neglect show improvements that can last
for hours or longer depending on the adaptation procedure. Recent work
has shown, however, that differential effects of prisms can be
observed on actions (which are typically improved) and perceptual
biases (which often remain unchanged). Here we present a computational
model capable of explaining some basic symptoms of neglect (line
bisection behaviour), the effects of prism adaptation in both healthy
controls and neglect patients and the observed dissociation between
action and perception following prisms. The results of our simulations
support recent contentions that prisms primarily influence behaviours
normally thought to be controlled by the dorsal stream.
